# sote_launcher
Source code of the launcher for Songs of the Eons.
The launcher sets off some anti virus software.
We're leaving the launcher open source so that people can compile it locally instead of trusting our word.
The launcher is needed to reserve memory for tectonic generation stage. It uses constant memory addresses that happen to collide with some of the ones used by Mono.
